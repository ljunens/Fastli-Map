# Fastli-Map
This is a little project I made for fastli.pl.
The main task was just to make the job search map look cool and interactive.

It puts job listings on a map of Warsaw. When you look at it:
Bouncing Dots: The job locations are marked with little blue dots that bounce around (I used CSS animations for that!).
Pop-up Info: Click a dot, and a small box pops up with the job title and a star rating.
Looks Good Everywhere: I made sure it works fine on my phone too

Tech Used:
Leaflet.js, HTML/CSS/JS
